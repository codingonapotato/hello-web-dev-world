## Overall website design and source code attributed to the following online tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dam0GPOAvVI&list=PLGk5tFMdVqPYRFI6nBg9mY6c4kEfK7UBu&index=8&t=307s. 

I followed the tutorial and wrote the code for this project while stopping intermittently to ensure that I was not simply copying code. I took the time to write comments in the code-base and to Google unfamiliar concepts to demonstrate that I was digesting and assimilating the information into my skillset. I also personalized the project by implementing a dark mode feature as well as an additional subpage that is unique to my project.
