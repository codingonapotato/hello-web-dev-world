## What is the Notes Web Application?
Notes Web Application is my first ever attempt at a functional web development project. Users of the application can sign-up for an account and create notes that are associated with the user's unique account. Furthermore, the website supports dark mode & light mode and remembers the user's preference for either form of the website. Finally, users that are logged in can interact with a minigame where they can click a button to retrieve pictures of cute cats from a public API because who does not like cats?
